**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was a study on how skincare products
affect the microbiome of people. As a person who loves researching skincare products, learning about
how skincare products influence the health and aging of my skin makes me interested in what ingredients
and micro-organisms are beneficial to introduce to my skin microbiome.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 project would be how the skin microbiome may influence
a person's risk of getting skin cancer or other skin-related diseases. Looking at the gut microbiome as well could also
see if there is a link between healthier skin and the foods you are consuming.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

One potential change I'd make to our approach taken in our current Quarter 1 Project is that instead of working individually on the same model, I would want a clear outline of how our trained model would work, the reasons as to why we made the decisions we made in our model, and actionable steps that we can make to gauge our progress for our project.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I would be interested in creating more graphics on our microbiome data such as cluster analysis, box-and-whisker plots, and curve fitting. Moreover, I'm interested in incorporating ReZero normalization into our model.
